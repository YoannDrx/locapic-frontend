#  📚 Locapic

Hi,
I'm Yoann, I'm currently deepening my knowledge in web development. I'm specialized in React frontend development.
I had fun coding all these projects!
Feel free to ask me questions and don't hesitate to look at my other projects ;)
Have fun coding!

## ✍️ Description 

**Part 1: Setting up the environment and navigation**

Today, you will discover the Expo and React Native environment, integrate the three screens and their style, and set up the application's navigation using the React Navigation library.

**Part 2: Integrating Redux and a French cities API**

Today, you will continue to learn about Expo and React Native by integrating Redux and making the "Places" screen dynamic with an API that can search for cities in France.

**Part 3: Creating a dynamic map with markers**

You will discover the possibilities of the react-native-maps and expo-location modules by creating a fully dynamic map where it will be possible to add and remove markers.

**Part 4: Saving markers to a backend**

The goal of this final part of Locapic is to save all the markers in a database so that they can be retrieved when the application is relaunched.

You will be faced with an essential mechanic in mobile application development: communication between the frontend and the backend.

This challenge is suitable for developers who want to improve their skills with React Native, Expo, Redux, and integrating with a backend. Feel free to fork this project and start coding!
